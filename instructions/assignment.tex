\subsection{Where to find help} % (fold)
\label{sub:where_to_find_help}

In order to find documentation for Erlang functions, try Google, the reference
manual\footnote{\url{http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/index.html}}, and
possibly \url{http://erldocs.com}.
To better understand the algorithms, refer to the course slides or textbook
\cite{cachin2011}.

You can email me questions about your design and problems with Erlang. Please
also arrange by email if you want to meet in person.

It's ok to talk to the other students about how to solve the problems, but
don't copy their code.
